# Motivation

reformat property,for a http header name cannot contain the following prohibited characters: =,;: \t\r\n\v\f

for example:
{"city=shanghai":"tag"}
when we run `bin/pulsar-admin topics get-message-by-id `, it will throw exception, the exception is:
`Reason: java.util.concurrent.CompletionException: org.apache.pulsar.client.admin.internal.http.AsyncHttpConnector$RetryException: Could not complete the operation. Number of retries has been exhausted. Failed reason: a header name cannot contain the following prohibited characters: =,;: \t\r\n\v\f: =`

# High Level Design

In master branch, 
in an http request:getMessageById("/{tenant}/{namespace}/{topic}/ledger/{ledgerId}/entry/{entryId}"),
replace `"X-Pulsar-PROPERTY-" + msgProperties.getKey()` with `"X-Pulsar-PROPERTY"`

After release-3.1.0, this feature begins to take effect.
